# IPL-Data-Analysis | WIDS
This repository contains the codes and report for EDA and Data Analysis done during the project.

## Phase 1:
Exploratory Data Analysis tasks were carried out:
<ol>
  <li>Finding maximum number of wins by any team in particular seasons.</li>
  <li>Which stadium hosted the most number of IPL matches?</li>
  <li>Which team has won the most number/percentage of matches?</li>
  <li>Which player has won the most number of Man of the Match (MoM) awards?</li>
  <li>Team wise toss statistics and their decision corretness</li>
  <li>What are the top 10 greatest victories (by runs and by wickets)?</li>
  <li>Most 50s and 100s scored.</li>
  <li>Plotly scatter plot for comparison between any number of batsman</li>
  <li>Made a bi-histogram plot for some Team1 vs Team2 with x axis as different years. This will give us an estimate of how the two teams perform against each other    over the years. Make a function so that we can easily put two different teams.</li>
</ol>
Tasks can be found in the file <i>EDA.ipynb</i>

## Phase 2:
Utilized different Machine Learning models to Perform Classification Task (Predicting the Winner of the a match) and Regression Task (Final score prediction). And finally compaired the accuracies and by hyperparamter tuning and obtained the best model.
<ul>
  <li>Score Prediction : Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression, Random Forest</li>
  <li>Winner Prediction : Support Vector Classifier, Random Forest Classifier and also regressors using a custom accuracy function</li>
</ul>

## Phase 3:
Implemented Neural Networks to acheive the above tasks.
